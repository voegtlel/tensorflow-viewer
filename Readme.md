== Introduction ==

This project was created during my masters project at the University of Freiburg.

The purpose is to provide a more advanced viewer than tensorboard, which is limited in a few ways which I desired for development.

== Features ==

 - View images in tfevents
 - View scalars in tfevents
 - View images of a specific format in tfrecords (more advanced work in progress)
