# Introduction

This project was created during my masters project at the University of Freiburg.

The purpose is to provide a more advanced viewer than tensorboard, which is limited in a few ways which I desired for developing and debugging neural networks.

# Features

 - View images in tfevents
 - View scalars in tfevents
 - View images of a specific format in tfrecords (more advanced work in progress)

# License

Due to the dependency to PyQT5, this project must be under GPL. Thus the license is GPLv3.
